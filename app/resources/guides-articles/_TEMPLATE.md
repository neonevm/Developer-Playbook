Copy the raw code of this template file in GitHub to automatically create a tile for your article on the Guides & Articles page.

Don't forget to add the "Community" category when submitting your article so it appears in the right section.

You can write your content using regular Markdown or MDX, and include images and code blocks just like in any MD/MDX file.

Happy writing, and welcome to the Playbook! ðŸš€
